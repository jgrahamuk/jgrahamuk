![Howdy! I deliver software and help other devs do the same!](https://github.com/jgrahamuk/jgrahamuk/blob/main/header.svg)
<img src="https://github.com/jgrahamuk/jgrahamuk/blob/main/aboutme.svg" alt="Outside of tech, I'm an American living in the United Kingdom. I’m the father of three (mostly) lovely boys. When it comes to tech, I'm a Leicester based web developer and I’ve been building software since 1996. I've worked for companies like IBM, Boeing, Federal-Mogul, 3M and BSS. I enjoy working with tech like C#, Java, Javascript/Typescript, React/React Native, Angular, NodeJS and Python. I also spend a fair bit of my time at work (and even more after hours) helping newer folks grow as developers. I volunteer quite a bit in my local community gardening, picking litter and have even adopted my local train station!">
<img src="https://github.com/jgrahamuk/jgrahamuk/blob/main/gettingappsdone.svg" alt="I host a mostly non-technical podcast for software developers, called Getting Apps Done, where I chat with Kel Piffner about a wide variety of topics ranging from tips on planning software projects to getting that elusive first software job!">
![I help businesses through the software development process, from start to finish. Everything from initial discussions to help them understand what they can achieve to selecting technology, building infrastructure and managing the project and team to ensure it’s completed successfully. Here are just a couple projects I thought were pretty special! All Eyes a fashion startup and Everywhere Chat a browser based chat](https://github.com/jgrahamuk/jgrahamuk/blob/main/portfolio.svg)
![I've been doing this for a while, so the list of languages, tools, libraries and frameworks I've used is too long to bore anyone with. This is a selection of some of my current toolbelt. Typescript, Angular, C# and dot net, React, Node JS and Adobe XD](https://github.com/jgrahamuk/jgrahamuk/blob/main/mystack.svg)
![I think it’s really important to have hobbies outside your day job! The one I enjoy most just happens to be photography. If you’d like to see more, check out my Instagram!](https://github.com/jgrahamuk/jgrahamuk/blob/main/photography.svg)
