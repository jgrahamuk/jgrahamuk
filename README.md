<a target="_blank" href="https://joshuagraham.info"><img src="https://github.com/jgrahamuk/jgrahamuk/blob/main/aboutme.svg" alt="Outside of tech, I'm an American living in the United Kingdom. I’m the father of three (mostly) lovely boys. When it comes to tech, I'm a Leicester based web developer and I’ve been building software since 1996. I've worked for companies like IBM, Boeing, Federal-Mogul, 3M and BSS. I enjoy working with tech like C#, Java, Javascript/Typescript, React/React Native, Angular, NodeJS and Python. I also spend a fair bit of my time at work (and even more after hours) helping newer folks grow as developers. I volunteer quite a bit in my local community gardening, picking litter and have even adopted my local train station!"></a>
